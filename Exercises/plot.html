        <h1>Plot Overview</h1>
        <p>When Baby, portrayed by Ansel Elgort, was just a child, a tragic car accident claimed the lives of his parents, leaving him with a persistent ringing in his ears known as tinnitus. To escape these unwanted sounds, he immerses himself in music through his iPods. As a teenager, Babys life takes a turn for the worse when he attempts to steal a car he didnt realize belonged to a notorious crime boss named “Doc,” played by Kevin Spacey. Instead of turning Baby in, Doc decides to manipulate him into working off his debt, and thus, Baby becomes a skilled getaway driver, transporting various crews of robbers assembled by Doc.

            While managing this dangerous lifestyle, Baby spends his free time crafting unique remixes from snippets of conversations he records. He also looks after his deaf foster father, Joseph, played by C.J. Jones. At a diner, he encounters the charming waitress, Debora, played by Lily James, and the two quickly form a romantic bond.
            
            However, Babys life of crime takes a treacherous turn during what he hopes will be his last job. The operation goes sideways when the hotheaded Bats, played by Jamie Foxx, a criminal who immediately takes a disliking to Baby, shoots a security guard. The situation escalates further when an armed civilian pursues them, but Baby cleverly manages to escape the chaos and evade law enforcement. After settling his debt to Doc, Baby attempts to leave this life behind, encouraged by Joseph to take up a more honest career as a pizza delivery driver while continuing his relationship with Debora.
            
            Yet, Babys past catches up with him when Doc reappears during a romantic dinner with Debora. Doc coerces Baby into joining another heist crew under the threat of harming Debora. Reluctantly, Baby complies. This time, the crew consists of Buddy, played by Jon Hamm, his sharpshooting partner Darling, portrayed by Eiza González, and the dangerous Bats—an unusually repeat team, against Docs usual policies.
            
            The plan involves stealing money orders from a post office, but complications arise when Bats realizes they are dealing with undercover officers during a weapons purchase, leading to a deadly shootout. Unbeknownst to Bats, his actions threaten Babys relationship with Debora when he nearly kills her during a diner hold-up.
            
            Despite Docs anger towards the botched deal, Baby convinces him to proceed with the heist. As the night unfolds, Baby tries to flee with Debora to escape their life of crime. However, Buddy and Bats, suspicious of Babys intentions, confront him. Demonstrating a quick wit, Baby proves his loyalty by presenting the mixtapes hes created, which pacifies their concerns—at least temporarily.
            
            Things take a dark turn during the heist itself when Bats kills a security guard, prompting Baby to refuse to drive for the crew. This refusal triggers a violent confrontation where Baby ultimately retaliates, eliminating Bats in a fit of rage. With the police hot on their tail, the surviving crew members scatter while chaos erupts.
            
            As Baby races to save Joseph and attempt to start anew, he leaves a heartfelt message along with money for the care of his foster father. He rushes to Deboras diner, only to find Buddy waiting for him. In an explosive encounter, Baby is forced to shoot Buddy before making a daring escape with Debora just as law enforcement closes in around them.
            
            Eventually, Baby seeks assistance from Doc, who begrudgingly helps him but expresses his frustration at the havoc Baby has caused. Doc offers Baby a means of escape, sharing his own lost love story as a reminder of whats at stake. But just as freedom seems within reach, Buddy returns with vengeance in mind. The ensuing confrontation in a parking garage leads to a life-or-death struggle, where Baby must protect himself and Debora from Buddy’s wrath.
            
            In a gripping conclusion, Baby and Debora find themselves cornered by the police. With unwavering resolve, Baby surrenders, knowing that Debora should not be entangled in his criminal world. During Babys trial, the testimonies from Joseph, Debora, and various lives he touched through his heists provide a powerful defense. Despite the gravity of his actions, Baby receives a 25-year sentence, with the possibility of parole after five years.
            
            As he serves time, Baby holds onto the hope of a future with Debora, who promises to wait for him, sending heartfelt postcards throughout his incarceration. Finally, when Baby is released, he finds Debora waiting for him in the same way he had dreamed, and their love story reaches a poignant reunion as they embrace at last..</p>
